# Electrical Engineering

####This is basically a rework of my [GaussGunMod](https://github.com/TheUltimateHose/GaussGunMod/)
The Minecraft-forum thread for the GaussGunMod can be found [here!](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2545247-the-gauss-gun-mod)

In this rework I am splitting the mod up into multiple parts.
What used to be the GaussGunMod will be transformed into an 'Energy Weapons Addon'.
The base mod will get some automation stuff or something like that.

<br>

The first task in this rework will be to transform all the items from the GaussGunMod to items from this mod.
